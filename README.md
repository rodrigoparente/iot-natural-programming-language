# IoT Device Programmable Language Customization for Home Automation

This repository is part of the paper: [IoT Device Programmable Language Customization for Home Automation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8538503), published at the IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications. In this work, we present a descriptive language that enables the programmability of IoT devices functionalities without changing their source code. The proposed language allows the interaction between the end-user and IoT devices in a transparent and friendly way.
